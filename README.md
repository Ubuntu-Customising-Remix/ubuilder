ubuilder
========

uBuilder is a tool to create a a Linux distribution using Ubuntu as a base. uBuilder's base was originally created by Brian Brazil (bbrazil) for the <a href="http://gnewsense.org" target="_blank" title="The gNewSense Project">gNewSense project</a>. They called the script "builder", which has been discontinued and removed from thier servers.

uBuilder will be reworked (hacked, modded,changed...?) to fit the needs of <a href="http://cybernux.org" target="_blank" title="The Cybernux Linux速 Project">The Cybernux Linux速 Project</a>.

<a href="http://cybernux.org" target="_blank" title="The Cybernux Linux速 Project">The Cybernux Linux速 Project</a> is not going to be following gNewSense philosophy in anyway, if you want an absolutely "free" system - go there. WE are going to be removing a lot of stuff though. To start off with, we will be removing:

1) Ubuntu stuff that interferes with other stuff - slowing things down.
2) Unity will be compleely removed.
3) Packages that need to be fixed, changed for our purpose.
