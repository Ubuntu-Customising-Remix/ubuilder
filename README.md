ubuilder
========

uBuilder is a tool to create a a Linux distribution using Ubuntu as a base. uBuilder's base was originally created by Brian Brazil (bbrazil) for the gNewSense project</a>. They called the script "builder", which has been discontinued and removed from thier servers.

uBuilder will be reworked (hacked, modded,changed...?) to fit the needs of the Cybernux Linux® Project.

The Cybernux Linux® Project is not going to be following gNewSense philosophy in anyway, if you want an absolutely "free" system - go there. WE are going to be removing a lot of stuff though. To start off with, we will be removing:

  * _Ubuntu Specific_ stuff that interferes with other stuff - slowing things down.
  * _Unity_ will be compleely removed.
  * _Packages_ that need to be fixed, changed or built to suit the purpose of the Cybernux Linux® Project.


How this works:
===============

This is to large to add here. There will be a WIKI HowToUse soon.
