The licence of libgsm was found to be unclear, and as such suspect when it
came to freedom (ref: http://bugs.debian.org/397047 ). Since then, upstream
clarified the licence, by adding the following text:

Since the original terms of 15 years ago maybe do not make our
intentions completely clear given today's refined usage of the legal
terms, we append this additional permission:

      Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software
      for any purpose with or without fee is hereby granted,
      provided that this notice is not removed and that neither
      the authors nor the Technische Universitaet Berlin are
      deemed to have made any representations as to the suitability
      of this software for any purpose nor are held responsible
      for any defects of this software.  THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO
      WARRANTY FOR THIS SOFTWARE.
