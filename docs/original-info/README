This set of scripts is to create your own GNU/Linux distribution based on Ubuntu,
including a livecd and repositories. It removes the non-free elements of
Ubuntu. These scripts are currently used to create the gNewSense distribution.

The syslinux directory and much of gen-livecd was taken from the debian-live project, and subsequently modified. The ubiquity.png is from the ubiquity source package, with the Ubuntu logo removed via the GIMP.

These scripts are released under the GPLv2 or later.
